            From a young age I have always loved building stuff. My dad had a box of unused electrical components and called it the invention box.
						I would spend hours in there taking apart components, looking at the circuit boards, and letting my imagination run wild. I used to imagine the capacitors were
						 towers or buildings and that the circuit board was actually a city. The PCB traces were the city streets. My passion for knowledge never diminished, 
						even as I grew older I would seek to understand how things were made. I built ramps and funboxes for skateboarding, I made an html page to watch happy tree friends, 
						I spent hours in gamemaker learning about game development, I figured out how to make and publish a youtube video, going to college added more fuel to the fire.

            Iâ€™ve earned respect as a diligent, analytical leader and
            collaborator who guides team members in successfully realizing
            project and company objectives through a people-focused approach. As
            an out-of-the-box thinker, I remain committed to making continuous
            improvements in planning, process, communication, and teamwork to
            enable long-term growth and profitability.
